 This is a beginner-level portfolio I created to showcase my skills and progress in web development. The project is built using HTML and CSS, and it includes custom fonts to enhance the visual appeal of the design. The portfolio features a clean, user-friendly layout with responsive design principles to ensure it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

For styling, I used CSS to create a visually engaging experience with consistent colors, typography, and spacing. Iâ€™ve incorporated different CSS techniques, along with media queries for a responsive design. The custom fonts were chosen to reflect a modern aesthetic and improve readability.

The website is hosted on Netlify, which makes the deployment process fast and easy, providing a live link to share with potential employers or clients. The hosting also offers features like continuous deployment, so the site is automatically updated whenever I make changes to the code on GitHub.

While the portfolio is simple, it was a great learning experience where I applied foundational concepts of web development. In the future, I plan to add more functionality and features, such as JavaScript interactivity, as I continue to enhance my skills and expand my knowledge in the field of web development."
